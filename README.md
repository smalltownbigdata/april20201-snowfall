# Small Town Big Data: April 2021
## Snow Stripes: Visualizing the rhythms of winter with daily snowfall data in R

This repository contains the tutorial that accompanies [this blog post](https://www.smalltownbigdata.com/post/colorado-ski-town-snowfall-data). 

This beginner-friendly tutorial is cut-and-paste easy...until we get to the Shiny app creation. This is more advanced and will require some extra reading. You can work in any code editor or IDE, but if you're a beginner, I recommend downloading [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). 

All the data needed to make your own Snow Stripes are available in the /data folder in this repository. Code is available in the april2021-snowfall.html file or at [this link](https://smalltownbigdata.github.io/april2021-snowfall/april2021-snowfall.html).
